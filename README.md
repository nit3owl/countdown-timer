# [Teacher Timer](https://github.com/nit3owl/teacher-timer)

[Teacher Timer](https://github.com/nit3owl/teacher-timer) is a simple pet project timer written primary in JavaScript (with a dash of jQuery.) It's normal mode is just a simple timer, but it also contains a "teacher mode" with alternative styling. The basic styling is done with [Flat UI](https://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/) which is wrapped in the [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) theme.

## Getting Started

* Fork this [repository](https://github.com/nit3owl/teacher-timer) on GitHub

If you would like to use the timer by itself (without the surrounding Freelancer theme) refer to standaloneTimer.html. The startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.2 directory is only needed for the index.html page (used by GitHub pages) so it can be tossed. The rest of the assets are still required for basic functionality and the Flat UI desgn. 

If you use this timer for your on project, please remove any contact links to me (without removing attribution.) Thanks!
